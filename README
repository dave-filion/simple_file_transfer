Welcome to sendr & recievr -> the really bad file transfer service.

To run, simply:

make clean

make

./runServer.sh &

And for a sample transfer:
./sendFile.sh

And to compare the before and after files:
./compare.sh

To send a different file, use the client like so...
./client/bin/sender <FILENAME> <IP_TO_SEND_TO>

Enjoy!
